# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This application is a daily scheduler, it has 1 hour timeslots throughout the day from 9am-5pm for you to input any events that you have on or need to complete. The technologies I used were HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used these technologies as these are the ones i'm currently learning and am practicing to become fluent in these languages. The challenging part of this this project was getting the events to save to local storage for its specific timeslot and then calling it from local storage and displaying it into its corresponding text area when the page was refreshed.

## Running the project

The project can be accessed through the following webpage and Repository URl's:
Webpage: https://andysu7117.github.io/work_day_scheduler/
Github Repository: https://github.com/Andysu7117/work_day_scheduler

The landing page should look like this:

## How to use

To use this project you just have to put in your event for the current day to their corresponding timeslot and press the save button. Once saved the events will stay their even when you refresh the page. Past timeslots will display grey, current red and future one's in green.
